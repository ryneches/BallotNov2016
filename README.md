# Russell's Ballot, November 2016

My personal voter guide for the November 2016 election. Consolidated Precinct
49, Yolo County, California.

### Why am I doing this

There's too much stuff on this year's ballot for me to keep it organized in my
head. This repository is my own personal voter guide for November. I'm sharing
them here in case other people are feeling overwhelmed, and maybe wondering
what other people are thinking about these issues.

These are my personal opinions; I'm trying to do what I think is right. Feel
free to submit pull requests if you think I'm wrong about something, but I'll
only pay attention to requests with clear, cogent arguments.

### Candidates

#### President

Hillary Clinton : I had my doubts about her as a candidate, but I think she's
demonstrated that she is capable of leading. 

There are still some open questions about the business with her private email
server and connections with the Clinton Global Initiative, but I have not seen
any convincing evidence of unethical or seriously improper behavior. This is
despite intense, prolonged attention by people who have strong motivation to
find and publicize damaging things about her. Similarly, the case (or rather
cases) for her culpability in the Benghazi incident looks like a lot of
nonsense. As Secretary of State it was her job to be responsible for any
mistakes or errors in judgment that occurred under her supervision, and it
seems to me that she discharged that duty appropriately.

As far as her opponent is concerned, the less is said the better.

#### Senate

Kamala Harris : I'm not as sure on this one, but Harris kinda sounds like
Warren-lite. I guess that's cool.

### Propositions

#### 51 School Bonds. Funding for K–12 School and Community College Facilities. Initiative Statute.

YES : Yay schools!

#### 52 Medi-Cal Hospital Fee Program. Initiative Constitutional Amendment and Statute.

YES : This initiative makes permanent the mechanism California uses to pay for
Med-Cal. Opponents seem to think this is an opportunity to address executive
pay (which I agree is a problem), but this doesn't seem to be relevant.

#### 53 Revenue Bonds. Statewide Voter Approval. Initiative Constitutional Amendment.

NO : It's already stupid that we have to vote on every bond.

#### 54 Legislature. Legislation and Proceedings. Initiative Constitutional Amendment and Statute.

YES : I'm sure more transparency will be annoying for legislators and make it
easier for lobbyists to lobby, but it also makes it easier for the public to
keep an eye on their legislature. The latter is more important.

#### 55 Tax Extension to Fund Education and Healthcare. Initiative Constitutional Amendment.

YES : We need to overhaul the tax code, but as long as we're doing things
piecemeal, I'm in favor of taxing rich people to pay for public schools and
hospitals.

#### 56 Cigarette Tax to Fund Healthcare, Tobacco Use Prevention, Research, and Law Enforcement. Initiative Constitutional Amendment and Statute.

YES : The main reason to oppose taxes on tobacco is that it's regressive; more
poor people smoke than rich. This measure diverts about half of the revenue it
will raise to Medi-Cal, which provides health care for many of those folks. In
terms of fairness, maybe that's not perfect. But it's good enough.

California's taxes on tobacco products are pretty low, as states go. This
measure would put our tobacco taxes a bit above the middle, but not at the
top.

#### 57 Criminal Sentences. Parole. Juvenile Criminal Proceedings and Sentencing. Initiative Constitutional Amendment and Statute.

YES : Long sentences don't seem to be a very effective at deterring crime.
Where public safety allows, I think we need to put more emphasis on
rehabilitation.

#### 58 English Proficiency. Multilingual Education. Initiative Statute.

YES : English immersion works for some students, but not for all of them. It
has been absurd, and racist, to legislate immersion as the only legal option.
I'm also in favor of improving access to second language classes for English
speakers.

#### 59 Corporations. Political Spending. Federal Constitutional Protections. Legislative Advisory Question.

YES : I'm not really sure why this needs to be on the ballot, but sure.
*Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission* was a bad decision. 

#### 60 Adult Films. Condoms. Health Requirements. Initiative Statute.

NO : This is a workplace safety issue that should be decided among the people
it actually affects. People outside the industry have no legitimate say in it.
It would be a different question if people in the industry were asking for the
public to intervene, but that's not what's going on here. Just the opposite,
actually.

#### 61 State Prescription Drug Purchases. Pricing Standards. Initiative Statute.

WTF : I have no idea. I'm inclined to vote YES simply because of the awfulness
of the people on the NO side, but I'm not convinced the measure itself will,
you know, *help*, and I'd rather not tie our hands if someone comes up with a
better idea.

#### 62 Death Penalty. Initiative Statute.

YES : There are people who do things that are so terrible that they *deserve*
to die, but actually killing them is a different moral proposition with
ramifications far beyond any judgment about that person. Even if our system
were reliable and fair (which it is not), I think it would still be a bad
idea. The reality of our death penalty system is that it is racist, unfair,
and there is no evidence that it does anything to stop people from committing
murder.

#### 63 Firearms. Ammunition Sales. Initiative Statute.

YES : A lot of this is already law, so a YES vote is more of a gesture. It
just happens to be a gesture I'd like to make.

#### 64 Marijuana Legalization. Initiative Statute.

YES : Obviously. It's already basically legal. May as well make it official
and collect some taxes, and deny some business opportunities for criminal
organizations. The [SacBee
disagrees](http://www.sacbee.com/opinion/editorials/article102380352.html),
but for totally stupid reasons. The health effects of marijuana and tobacco
are almost completely unrelated. Marijuana is not linked to any major public
health issue, unless you include the effects of police harassment on health.

Yes, probably more people will smoke marijuana for the fun of it if this
passes. Yes, some of these people will do dumb and maybe destructive things
while stoned. Probably, though, recreational marijuana use will displace some
alcohol use, which will be better for everyone. Alcohol is *ridiculously*
destructive. Even if overall drug use goes up, trading even a small portion of
alcohol for marijuana will make everyone safer.

And, it does seem likely that displacement would happen. It does not seem
likely that the availability of legal marijuana would lead people to suddenly
spend more time under the influence. Most people I know basically schedule
their time spent intoxicated, and new drug options won't change how the rest
of their lives work.

The only serious opposition is worried about driving under the influence.
Speaking as someone who does not plan to partake, I would *much* prefer to be
around a bunch of stoned people than a bunch of drunk people. In my
experience, it's a lot easier to convince a stoned person that they're not
ready to drive. Stoned people are also usually less inclined to attack people
or smash things. I don't expect miracles here, but I think recreational
marijuana will mean safer public spaces. 

#### 65 Carryout Bags. Charges. Initiative Statute.

NO : This seems like an attempt to deliberately mislead voters in case Measure
67 passes. Garbage.

#### 66 Death Penalty. Procedures. Initiative Statute.

NO : This measure strips people of their right to due process so that it will
be more convenient for the state to kill them.

#### 67 Ban on Single-Use Plastic Bags. Referendum.

YES : Plastic bags are useful and convenient, but I've seen firsthand how
destructive they are.

### Local races

#### State Assembly

Bill Dodd : While I would like to support Davis local Mariko Yamada, her
support for the death penalty disqualifies her. As I said above, I agree with
Yamada that there are people who *deserve* the to die, but I can't get behind
a candidate who thinks we should actually *carry that out.* Not, at least,
while there's a chance that California could actually abolish it.

Dodd strikes me a bit to my right as candidates go, but I appreciate that he
seems to be quite serious about talking to the people affected by legislation
before he decides what to do. I would be happier if Dodd came right out and
condemned the death penalty, instead of [dropping hints that maybe it's a bad
idea](http://www.bohemian.com/TheFishingReport/archives/2016/02/10/dodd-and-country-talking-with-senate-candidate-and-assembly-ag-committee-chair-bill-dodd).

#### School district

Susan Lovenburg, Alan Fernandes (incumbents) : The main issue here is [whether
and how to reform the gifted
program](http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/education/article27015826.html) in
the Davis Public Schools. The program, called the "Alternative Instruction
Model," is very similar to a program I participated in when I was in 5th and
6th grades. Basically, the "gifted" kids get to leave the classroom and go do
something more fun and interesting.

This was wonderful for me. Our gifted program was project based; instead of
listening to a teacher lecturing, we worked individually or in group on fun
little projects. The projects always seemed easy and fluffy to me, but I think
I still got more out of them than regular classroom stuff. I *hated* every
minute I had to spend in a classroom in elementary school. It didn't really
matter if I was behind or ahead of the class. Sitting quietly and listening to
a lecture was just terrible. So, I'm all for alternatives to the traditional
classroom.

However, I remember what it was like in 4th grade, before the school district
thought I was smart enough. At some point in the day, the kids I looked up to
got to leave. I had to stay behind with the kids who liked to kick me around
at recess. It made me feel... pretty awful. Like, suicidal ideation kind of
awful.

In the end, I think primary education is more about teaching small humans how
not to be monsters. Letting the "gifted" kids leave their "not-gifted"
classmates behind while they get special rewards is basically just putting an
official school district endorsement on elitism. Of course we need to make
sure school is challenging and interesting, but segregation has never been a
good solution for anything.

I've listened to a number of parents and students about the AIM program, and
frankly, I find their thoughts on it to be repugnant in the extreme. Racist
would be the *most charitable* way to describe it. 

A *third* of Davis kids are in the AIM program. If that many of them can
handle it, then all of them can handle it with a little help. I want the Davis
schools to continue dismantling this program, and instead focus on making
instruction work for all the kids.

#### Measure H

YES : The only way the school district can succeed in modernizing instruction
is if it has the resources to try.

#### Los Rios Community College District Area 4

Ruth Scribner (incumbent) : Everything I hear about the community colleges
around here indicate that they could probably use more state support, but
they're run pretty well.
